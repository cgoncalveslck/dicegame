# Dice Game - WebSocket Backend & Next.js Frontend

This is a dice game project built for a technical challenge. It’s got a **Go backend** for handling the game logic and WebSocket communication, and a **Next.js frontend** for the UI. Players can bet on dice rolls (odd or even), and the backend keeps track of their wallet balance and play history.
